# ACADEMIC-PROJECTS
The projects uploaded in this repository are those that have been done by me while the ongoing course of Post Graduate Program in Data Analytics at Imarticus Learning.

These projects vary from basic Data Exploration to various Machine Learning methods to Deep Learning methods.

Machine Learning methods comprise of Supervised Learning methods such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifier etc. Unsupervised Learning methods are also used like K-Means Clustering.

In addition, Time Series projects are also included. These projects have been done by both Time Series Modelling methods and Deep Learning Methods such as RNN and LSTM.

Deep Learning methods include Artificial Neural Network, Convolution Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, LSTM etc.

Advanced Projects such as Image Recognition, Face Recognition etc. are also in this repository.

Projects using Natural Language Processing to express the sentiments of reviews, forecasting the words from incomplete search are also included here.
