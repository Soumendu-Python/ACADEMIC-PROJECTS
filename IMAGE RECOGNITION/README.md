##IMAGE RECOGNITION USING CNN##
This project is based on Image Recognition through Convolution Neural Network technique.

There are images belonging to 6 categories in the dataset namely Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea and Street.

Through the CNN structure, the model will be able to predict correctly as to which image we have provided to it.

There are 3 folders i.e. train, test and prediction. The CNN model will run on the basis of train and test images. Then it will be provided with an image from the prediction and thus the efficiency of the model to classify the image correctly will be assumed.

The dataset for this project being very large, is provided in the below link
