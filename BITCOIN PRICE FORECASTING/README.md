# BITCOIN PRICE FORECASTING USING LSTM
This dataset consists of High, Low, Open and Close prices of Bitcoin CryptoCurrency as well as their Volume and Marketcap. We are interested in only Close Prices on a daily basis.

The requirement of the following project is to forecast the Close Prices of Bitcoin for the next 31 days using Stacked LSTM i.e. Long Short Term Memory, which is an improvised version of Recurrent Neural Network.

In the dataset, we are provided with the prices of Bitcoin from 29th April 2013 to 6th July 2021. Therefore, we will be needing the Close Prices of Bitcoin from 7th July 2021 to 7th August 2021.

Of course, this project is based on the historical data Bitcoin Close Prices and must not be used in the real-time market as there are real-time factors coming into play.
