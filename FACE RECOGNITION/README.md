# FACE RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK
The Face Recognition project uses deep learning methods to recognize a face.
Here, the technique of Convolution Neural Network is used to break the images of faces into layers of pixels to predict the faces accurately.

A total of 48 images of my friends were collected for the project, 32 images for Training and 16 images for Validation. 

The dataset being quite large to upload, link for the same has been written below
