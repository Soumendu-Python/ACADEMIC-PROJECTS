# FACE RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK
The Face Recognition project uses deep learning methods to recognize a face.
Here, the technique of Convolution Neural Network is used to break the images of faces into layers of pixels to predict the faces accurately.

The dataset being quite large to upload, link for the same has been written below
