# SOUND CLASSIFICATION
The dataset contains sounds from 10 different categories. A model needs to be made that will recognize as to what type of source of the sound that is played.
Categories such as dog barking, children playing, siren, street music etc. are some of the sounds that are included in the dataset.
The model is trained in such a way that when a sound is played, it will classify its source.

About 8500+ sound files are present in the dataset. The metadata contains the location of each and every sound file.
Each sound wave will be converted into array of numbers as per its sample rate and frequency.
Then the arrays and sound categories are arranged in the form of a dataframe and then trained into a machine learning model.
