# OCEAN TEMPERATURE PREDICTION
This repository contains prediction of Ocean Temperature using Salinity of Ocean Water with Multiple Regression Models

The dataset contains many factors recorded from bottles found in the ocean procured by CalCOFI i.e. California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, but the main purpose of this dataset is to predict Temperature of ocean water using only its Salinity.

The following problem has been solved using many models of regression and at the end it will be decided as to which model is the best by comparing their r2 scores.

Result of each and every model has also been plotted using the "Yellowbrick" library so as to visualize the prediction error and the nature of residuals for estimating the efficiency of the models.

The dataset can be acquired from the given link as the dataset is more than 25MB https://www.kaggle.com/soumenduchatterjee/ocean-temperature-vs-salinity
